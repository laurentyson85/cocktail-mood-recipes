## Description
Cocktail Mood Recipes is a JavaScript application that leverages DOM manipulation allowing users to select their mood and spirit to return a cocktail recipe. I built this application because, as a kid, I loved mood rings, and as an adult, I love cocktails. [Check out this two-minute video walkthrough of my app](https://youtu.be/APgdl-WwKyM) and [my blog post](https://dev.to/laurentyson85/utilizing-a-nested-get-request-3dj9) about the project; in the blog, I delve into some cool features!


## Installation

To install, please fork and clone this repository. Once you've cloned it to your terminal, make sure you ``cd`` into the correct folder. 


## Usage

After you're in your correct folder, type ``json-server --watch db.json`` in your terminal to start the server and ``open index.html`` (Macs) or ``explorer.exe index.html`` (Windows). The cocktail app will load so you can spin up a new recipe!
